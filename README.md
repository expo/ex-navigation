# ExNavigation

A route-centric Navigation library for React Native, powered by "NavigationExperimental".

---

*__Note:__ Documentation is coming soon! For now, check out the example project in `example/`. This lib is very much a work in progress. It was developed in conjunction with the li.st Android app, and had a lot of internal ties to the li.st codebase. We've worked on a cleaning up a bunch, but it's not exactly where we'd like it to be yet. Stay tuned in the next few weeks for docs and more code cleanup.*

### How to run the example project:

This will start the packager for react-native:

```
git clone git@github.com:exponentjs/ex-navigation.git
cd ./ex-navigation
npm install
npm run run-example
```

Open a new terminal to deploy to the simulator.

```
cd ./example/ExNavigationExample
react-native run-ios
react-native run-android
```

OR

```
cd ./example/ExNavigationExample
react-native run-android
```

# ExNavigation

*Documentation is coming soon! For now, check out the example project in `example/`. This lib is very much a work in progress. It was developed in conjunction with the li.st Android app, and had a lot of internal ties to the li.st codebase. We've worked on a cleaning up a bunch, but it's not exactly where we'd like it to be yet. Stay tuned in the next few weeks for docs and more code cleanup.*

# How to run example

```
  This will start the packager for react-native
  
  git clone git@github.com:exponentjs/ex-navigation.git
  cd ex-navigation
  npm install
  npm run run-example
  
  Open a new terminal to deploy to the simulator
  
  cd /ex-navigation/example/ExNavigationExample
  react-native run-ios
```
